# SwitchCraft

Living in New York, we attempt to keep up with the fast paced environment inherent to this city. We breeze by members of our local community unaware of the trades and skill sets they may have to offer. We need a way to foster community ties and share our individual expertise. 
Likewise, prices for services continue to rise making these resources difficult to afford for anyone in a lower income bracket. All too often we try to set a value to a particular skill rather than understanding that each area of expertise carries the same merit.
SwitchCraft is a iOS mobile application marketplace where you can connect with members of your community and trade skill sets. Every hour that you volunteer to one member earns you one time credit. These credits can be used to trade in for anotherâ€™s skill. 


SwitchCraft currently has UI set up for various View Controllers. My next step will be to implement posts in order for users to request help for trades and services. Once that is implemented the next step will be to enable users to accept those requests and transferring the time credits between users.
